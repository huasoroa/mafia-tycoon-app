# Ricardo's Crime Tycoon Game

## Description

I don't have my desktop right now and I'm bored so I decided to make a game ðŸ™„.

I'm using Next.js and Postgres to create a new app.

The game will be a simple crime tycoon game where you can play as a mafia capo and you will have to climb the ladder of success.

## To do list

- [x] Create a new Next.js app
- [x] Deploy app
- [x] Mock ui using fake data
- [x] Create a new Postgres database
- [x] Connect to database
- [ ] Create player with passive income generation
  - [ ] Add repeatable action (beg) that can provide a random amount of money
  - [ ] Add basic passive income generation (have someone deal for you)
